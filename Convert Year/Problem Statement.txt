Databases written in 1970's used 2-digit fields to represent the year e.g., 77, 80 instead of 1977, 1980.
However with the year 2000 nearby all these fields had to be changed to be 4-digit date. 
Write a program to change a given 2-digit year to a 4-digit year. 
Remember that if the 2-digit number is less than 35 it means itâ€™s a year in the 2000-year range. E.g., 15 would mean 2015 not 1915.
